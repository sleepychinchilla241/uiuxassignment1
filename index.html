				For this project, I chose to focus on the multimedia and 
				projector interface in the DeCiccio Family Auditorium of the 
				Salomon Center for Teaching.
				I chose this interface because I felt there were a wide range of
				 experiences users could have with using that interface, and  
				because it had a number of interactive components and features 
				that users could use. The key components of the interface are 
				highlighted and labelled below. <br>
				The image below shows the basic interface. The cables indicate 
				to users that they can connect their personal devices to the 
				display, while the larger monitor and the drawer indicate that 
				they have the alternative of logging into the connected computer
				and displaying content from that computer.
			</p>

				The image below shows the basic settings or default window of 
				the control panel of the interface. A menu on the right allows 
				the user to navigate and adjust different systems settings,
				while the title at the top informs them of where they are. This
				basic mode lets them select a method of connecting a device, 
				adjusting the volume and selected room controls, and to shutdown
				the system. It is worth noting that the icon for the basic and 
				advanced settings are counterintuitive - the basic settings have
				a star icon (stars are generally associated with special things),
				while the advanced settings have a gear icon (which is usually
				associated with general settings). Other icons used are more 
				intuitive and used in a standard context/manner (like the lights
				and mute icons).

				This image shows the display controls once a connected device
				has been chosen. Salient features here are the colour-coded on 
				and off buttons for the projector and screen, the back button to
				take the user back to the previous screen, and the multiple
				"Mute display" buttons. It is worth noting that the term "mute 
				display" is slightly ambiguous and confusing and it is not
				immediately clear to the user what that button does.

			<h3>
				&rarr; Tech-Savvy Tim
			</h3>
			<p class="userInterviewDescr">
				Tech-Savvy Tim works with Brown's Office of Information Technology 
				(OIT). He said he usually interacts with the interface to set it
				 up for professors to use in classes. He has been interacting 
				with the setup for a little over a year, and is now quite 
				familiar with it. He said he started out not knowing anything 
				about the setup or AirMedia, and was trained by senior OIT staff
				in the use of the interface. Despite being overwhelmed by the 
				setup initially, Tim feels like he has gotten more comfortable
				with the device and all its features from using it on a daily 
				basis and experimenting with the system. He did acknowledge that 
				the device still manages to stump him on occasion with a strange
				 error or issue, especially since it does not have a user manual
				or guide, but he has a good idea of how to troubleshoot now.
				He reported that the sometimes the only solution is to do a 
				back-end reset or to connect wirelessly using AirMedia.  
				Tim did mention occasionally feeling stressed and overwhelmed 
				when trying to troubleshoot the system for a professor while 
				working against the clock. <br> <br>
				From my observations, Tim appeared to be methodical and 
				following a process when working with the interface to set it up
				for the professor, barely looking up from what he was doing 
				while setting it up. He did not display any outward signs of 
				shock, distress, or irritation with the interface while using it.
			</p>
			<h3>
				&rarr; Professor P
			</h3>
			<p class="userInterviewDescr">
				Professor P is teaches a course in life sciences, and so only 
				works with computers as educational tools. His primary goal 
				in using the device is to enable classes to run smoothly and 
				allow students to see material projected onto a larger screen. 
				He said his intention behind using the clicker and pointer was 
				to make it easier to walk while talking and to interact with and
				watch students during the lecture, which would be much harder if 
				he stayed near the computer interface. Professor P was familiar
				with connecting to the interface and presenting using it, and
				was aware of an additional feature that allows presenters to 
				annotate their presentations using a stylus provided with the 
				interface. He reported learning to use these features within a 
				few minutes, and that most of this was intuitive and that he was
				used to interacting with new technology and exploring its uses. 
				Professor P regarded the interface as a tool to be used in the 
				background that should not interfere with the message of what he
				 was teaching, and reported a mostly frictionless user 
				experience, but acknowledged that it could be overwhelming to a 
				first-time user or someone less tech-savvy. <br> <br>
				From my observations, Professor P was also methodical and 
				appeared to be following some set of instructions on his screen 
				when connecting his device to the interface. He connected to the
				 interface using his personal laptop and primarily interacted 
				with it using this laptop, a clicker, and a laser pointer. He 
				did indeed walk around a lot and interact with the audience when
				 using the projector interface, as mentioned during his 
				interview. It is worth noting that I was not able to locate the 
				stylus mentioned by Professor P near the interface.

			<h3>
				&rarr; Professor G
			</h3>
			<p class="userInterviewDescr">
				Professor G teaches also teaches a course in a non-CS discipline.
				Professor G also used the interface primarly to present content 
				for classes, and reported familiarity with only the basic 
				features of the interface. His overall impression of the 
				interface was that it worked correctly, and said he found it 
				easy to use for his purposes and that he learnt how to use it in
				a span of minutes because of how intuitive it was. However, he 
				did also report a problem with people changing settings on the 
				device and finding it difficult to return them to his preferred
				settings. Professor G also mentioned that he needs someone from 
				OIT to come reset the system for him before he can use it, but
				believed that this was not an issue with the interface as much
				as it was an issue with the maintenance and administration of 
				the auditorium and the interface. <br><br>
				Professor G appeared to have a smooth experience using the
				interface during class, and did not have to stop the 
				presentation at any point to adjust the settings. He did not
				take time to connect to the interface and use it nor did he 
				adjust things on his end before looking at the projector screen.

			<h3>
				&rarr; Talented Tiffany
			</h3>
			<p class="userInterviewDescr">
				Talented Tiffany is a student and a member of a performing arts
				group that often practices in the auditorium. Various members of
				the group have needed to connect to the multimedia interface in
				the past to play music or a video for the group during 
				practices. Tiffany, being a new member of the group, was still a
				 little unfamiliar with the interface and faced some issues 
				connecting to it. While she understood that she needed to 
				connect her laptop using the cables provided with the interface,
				she had trouble working with the audio settings and had to ask 
				her friends to help. She found it easy to connect to the system
				but wasn't sure how its volume controls interacted with those on
				her laptop, and but felt more comfortable using the system after
				she understood what was going on. <br><br>
				Tiffany did indeed take some time getting connected to the 
				system, and frequently looked at the projector screen and the 
				projector itself after doing something on her laptop or the 
				screen attached to the interface. She went through a similar 
				process with the audio controls, playing the audio a few times 
				and adjusting something on her screen or the multimedia system's
				screen after.
